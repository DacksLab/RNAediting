Putative mRNA sequences were selected from the contigs assembled by Trinity using a pipeline of three Python scripts. The first of which extracts any potential ORF with a minimum length of 40 aa from the contig data. The second script executes a BLASTp search on each ORF found, comparing it to a custom database of dinoflagellate plastid protein sequences (Obtained from the MMETSP paper. Not sure how to cite them.). The final script in the pipeline, parses the output from the BLASTp searches, and selects the most likely protein coding contig for a given gene based on e-value and contig length.
